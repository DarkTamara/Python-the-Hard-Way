Notite si chestii care mi s epare mie ca ar trebui sa le tin:

to run stuff, powershell and python before the name
^ (caret) 
# pound character (comments)
daca s chestii cu ' to print use " 
Why does the # in print "Hi # there." not get ignored?
The # in that code is inside a string, so it will be put into the string until the ending " character is hit. These pound characters are just considered characters and aren't considered comments.
